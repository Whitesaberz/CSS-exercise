      Glad you're interested in Japanese! it's a fun and challenging language to
      learn, due to several systems in place that come together to make the
      writing system work!

      <h3>Hiragana ひらがな</h3>
      <p>
        Hiragana is a type of alphabet the Japanese developed to be able to
        phonetically spell out Japanese characters "Kanji"(Looks more rounded,
        like cursive).

      <h3>Katakana カタカナ</h3>
      <p>
        Katakana was created as Japan finally opened it's borders in the mid
        1800's to phonetically spell out foreign words in a Japanese speech
        fashion. (They had to do this to translate sounds they weren't used to
        into something they could understand). It has a much more boxy and
        angular style than Hiragana.
      </p>

      <h3>Kanji 漢字</h3>
      <p>
        Kanji is where things get complex; Each character has it's own meaning
        and often times more than one pronunciation. When you put two or more
        Kanji together, they can have an entirely different meaning. For
        example: The word "teach" is a combination of the characters for
        "child", "old", and "hit". Which I find both terrible and hilarious.
